    <h3>Pinto beans are simmered with onion, tomatoes, chili powder, cumin, and garlic in this easy one-pot recipe. I love making these beans just because they make the whole house smell so good, and the longer they simmer the better they taste. You could add 1/2 can of beer to make "borracho" beans. I personally taste-test throughout the entire cooking process and add extra seasoning as I feel it needs it. These beans could simmer all day long; just make sure they have plenty of water to keep the beans covered.</h3>
